- Generate new API key
- Chat box and data overview section in split screen view
- For all inputs that the AI will use, find  a way to cleanly organize all the modules that may be needed into a file, so it just calls what it needs from the file
- A way to properly add LLM memory instead of just storing in a dict > solved with Gemini in-built chat_session
- Test out the code execution tool
- Limit file size to 30MB for now
- let AI be the one to priint out the table result itself
- Explore thinking model budgets





- AI should be able to show plots
- Better, more specific Error handling functions (network, request timeout, too many requests per time, etc.)
- Add clear comments
- As user sends the message, the "send" button should be disabled to avoid going over quota limit so fast
- Showing execution list/tuple/series in Text in stead of plain text/table
- Outputted a markdown instead of html response
- All dataframe/table output should be in a well formatted and styled table
